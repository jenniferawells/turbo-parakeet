In this project, I implemented a deep Q-learning model to navigate a maze in search of treasure. I did this using the ' qtrain' function. There is initialization in which the parameters are set with defaults, which can be overridden and the maze environment and experience replay memory are initialized. In the training loop, the agent starts at a random position in the maze. It decides on actions based on exploration or exploitation. After each action, the new state, reward, and game outcome are noted. This data is stored in memory, and the model is periodically trained on random samples from this memory. The training provides feedback about the progress, including the win rate. If the model is winning often, it reduces exploration in favor of exploitation. Training can end early if the model consistently succeeds. 

I was provided with two Python classes and a Q-learning skeleton implementation. The first Class, TreasureMaze.py, represents the environment, which includes a maze object defined as a matrix. The second class, GameExperience.py, stores the episodes, or all the states that come between the initial state and the terminal state. 

Computer scientists study and develop computational theories, algorithms, and systems to address a variety of challenges. Their roles include software development, AI research, data analysis, and cybersecurity, among others. Their work is pivotal for driving technological innovation, ensuring digital security, enhancing efficiency across industries, and finding solutions to complex problems in diverse fields. In essence, computer scientists play a crucial role in shaping modern technology, impacting almost every facet of our daily lives and the broader economy.

When approaching a problem as a computer scientist, I have found that a systematic and iterative method is effective. Defining the problem clearly, gathering relevant information through research, analyzing challenges, and planning appropriate strategies, data structures, and algorithms assist in the planning stages of tackling a problem. Designing the solution, implementing the solution, testing thoroughly, and evaluating the solution's performance along with documenting the work and communicating results allow for the identification of any gaps between the design and real-world application and ensure the reliability and stability of the solution. And Lastly, staying updated with evolving technologies as well as reflecting on the process and outcomes to improve future approaches. This type of approach combines logical thinking, creativity, and continuous learning to tackle problems.

Ethical responsibilities to end users and organizations are crucial in technology and computer science. To the End User, our responsibilities are to safeguard users' data, clearly communicate software operations and data practices, protect user data from threats, make software user-friendly and inclusive, prevent features that might harm users, ensure non-discriminative and unbiased systems, and be truthful about product capabilities and risks. 

To the organization, our responsibilities are to provide truthful information and address concerns, respect copyrights, and proprietary information, disclose potential personal-professional clashes, keep organizational information secure, maintain product and service standards, stay updated in the field, and address and report unethical practices. 

These ethical guidelines ensure trust, integrity, and the beneficial use of technology for all stakeholders.
